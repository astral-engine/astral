//! Container with persistent unique keys.
//!
//! Upon insertion a key is returned that can be used to later access or
//! remove the values. Insertion, removal and access all take O(1) time with
//! low overhead.
//!
//! The difference between a [`BTreeMap`] or [`HashMap`] and a slot map is
//! that the slot map generates and returns the key when inserting a value. A
//! key is always unique and will only refer to the value that was inserted.
//! A slot map's main purpose is to simply own things in a safe and efficient
//! manner.
